* How to use:
- Install NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/download/
- You can code in Javascript (for NodeJS), C++ or Java
- You can do stuffs in opponent's turn. But be careful! If you take too much time, you may miss your turn and lose.
- How to build:
	+ Javascript: No need to build. Bot file: Client.js
	+ C++: Use build mode that match your compiler version. E.g. You use VS2012, then you should build using 2012_Debug or 2012_Release. Bot file: AI_Template.exe
	+ Java: Run #build.bat (Use jdk 1.6.0_18 or later). Bot file: Client.jar
- Copy your bot file to Arena folder, and rename it as P1. (P1.exe, P1.js or P1.jar)
- Run P1-vs-You.bat to fight with your own bot for testing purpose
- If you want to play against someone else, copy their bot to Arena folder and rename it as P2. (P2.exe, P2.js or P2.jar)
- Run P1-vs-P2.bat
- Cross platform is OK (for example, P1.exe vs P2.js)
